## Function
	Variable scope is the section of code in which the indentifier refers to the expected value. Outside a variable's scope, the variable is undefined or replaced by another variable with the same name.
	Block scope, meaning that you can create blocks arbitrarily to cotain variables.
	The "var" keyword is not block scope.
	"var" uses function scope instead.
